    "- `do_stars` enables or disables the stars in the plot. It should be a boolean value, true or false.\n",

    "- `do_asterisms` enables or disables the asterisms, i.e. the lines between the stars in constellations. It should be a boolean value, true or false.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `do_moon` enables or disables overplotting the moon on the map. The moon will be plotted at the start of the observing window, unless `move_moon` is true, in which case the location of the moon will be plotted at several epochs during the observing window. It should be a boolean value, true or false.\n",

For example, if `move_moon` and `do_time_text` are both enabled, there will be text next to each image of the moon stating at what time during the observing run the moon will be at that location. This also works for other objects which do not have well-defined RA and DECs, such as planets or satellites. It should be a boolean value, true or false.\n",

    "- `do_xticks` enables or disables x axis (right ascension) labels. It should be a boolean value, true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `do_yticks` enables or disables y axis (declination) labels. It should be a boolean value, true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `do_title` enables or disables displaying the figure title directly on the figure. This is not useful for the report PDF, because the page associated with the all sky map already has its own title. But if you are not interested in the PDF and want this map as a standalone figure, which DINOS does produce and saves in the output folder, enabling the title directly on the plot may make sense. It should be a boolean value, true or false.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `do_obs_lines` enables or disables plotting lines on the map which represent the observable part of the sky at the beginning and end of the observing window. It should be a boolean value, true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `mag_limit` sets the limiting magnitude for plotting the stars if `do_stars` is true. Note that at higher values, i.e. enabling plotting fainter stars, the number of stars that are plotted grows dramatically and this can have a serious performance penalty. Additionally, because stars are plotted with transparency based on their magnitude, `mag_limit` values above 9 will have diminishing returns with fainter stars not being very visible on the plot. It is recommended to keep this value at or below 8.5, which is a nice middle ground between performance and visual quality.\n",

    "- `star_marker` changes the way matplotlib will dislpay the background stars on the map. It should be the same as a matplotlib marker style.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `target_marker` changes the way matplotlib will display your targets on the map. It should be the same as a matplotlib marker style.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `do_moon` enables or disables plotting the moon on the chart. It should be a boolean value, true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `do_grid` enables or disables plotting an altitude-azimuth grid on the chart. It should be a boolean value, true or false.\n",

    "- `do_moon_labels` enables or disables plotting the angular separation between your targets and the moon on the chart. If you have many targets, keeping this enabled may cause significant visual clutter. It should be a boolean value, true or false.\n",

    "The next subsection is `finder_images`. It configures the finder images created for each object. It is heavily based on astroplan's finder image functions and takes the following parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `survey` specifies the sky survey used for the finding charts.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `fov_radius` defines the radius of the finding chart in arcminutes. The default is 3.2, which corresponds to the field of view of the Nordic Optical Telescope.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `log` takes the natural logarithm of the finder chart image. This can be useful if the field has both faint and bright objects, and you want to be able to see the faint ones. It should be a boolean value, true or false.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `reticle` enables or disables plotting a reticle directly around your target. The reticle will be in the color of your target as defined automatically for the report PDF. It is highly recommended you keep this on, as that is the entire point of having a finding chart. But maybe if you have an extended object you don't want it for the sake of clutter. You do you.
