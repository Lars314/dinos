Display Information Needed for Observing Stuff
![](./report_images/titlebackground_v3.PNG "DINOS")

Have you ever tried getting ready for an observing run, and found yourself with 500+ browser tabs trying to get finding charts and rise and set times and airmass plots for your targets, and wanted to quit academia to go live in the woods because it was such a hassle? Well look no further because DINOS is the one more browser tab you need to finally make finding your finding charts easy!

The idea is this: put the names of your targets in a config file, run a python command, enjoy your nicely formatted PDF with all the information you need to observing stuff.

(as per [this](https://xkcd.com/927/) you probably will still need more than just DINOS to get *all* the information you need. But DINOS ought to help reduce the clutter)

See `Example.ipynb` for usage instructions.
